# Docker Port Mapping

This repository provides an introduction to Docker port mapping and demonstrates how to use it to expose containerized applications to the host machine.

## Introduction

Docker is a powerful containerization platform that allows you to package applications along with their dependencies into isolated containers. One of the key features of Docker is the ability to map ports between the container and the host machine, enabling external access to the containerized applications.

This repository aims to provide a clear understanding of Docker port mapping and guide you through the process of running containers with port mapping using practical examples.

## Port Mapping

Port mapping, also known as port forwarding, allows you to expose specific ports from a Docker container to the host machine. By mapping a port, you can access the services running inside the container using the host machine's IP address and the mapped port number.

Docker port mapping follows a syntax where you specify the host port and the container port, separated by a colon. For example, `-p <host-port>:<container-port>`. This maps the specified container port to the corresponding host port.

## Getting Started

To get started with Docker port mapping, follow these steps:

1. Install Docker on your machine by following the official Docker installation guide for your operating system.
